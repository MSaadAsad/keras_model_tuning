# Optimizing Neural Networks
Did you ever wonder which parameters are most impactful when it comes to neural networkings model tuning? I did. That's why I worked on this project. The goal was to develop intuition about neural network parameter tuning (including hyperparameter).

In this project, I use Keras to build a generic neural network class which can be used to test model performance. With the power of Colab GPU, building and tesing neural networks is a pleasure. So let's do this!
